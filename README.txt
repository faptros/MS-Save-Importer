<Monster Sanctuary Collection Tracker Save Importer>

To import your save you'll need to follow these steps:

- Have Excel (or any other software that's able to read .xlsx files.

- Go to https://www.saveeditonline.com/.

- Click on 'UPLOAD FILE' and select the save file you want to import.
 (you can find it under C:\Users\User\Documents\My Games\Monster Sanctuary\***numbers***\SavegameX.dat)

- Select all the text that the page shows (it's a lot of text, may take a while) and copy it.

- Open the folder 'MS_SaveImporter' -> 'dist' -> 'monster_to_xl' and look for a file named 'monstertxt.txt'.

- Open it, paste the text you copied and save it.

- Execute 'monster_to_xl.exe'. (it's in the same folder as the 'monstertxt.txt' file)

- It will generate a file named 'output.xlsx' in this same folder.

- Copy the Neutral/Light/Dark columns to the Collection Tracker on google sheets.

- Reformat if the formatting breaks.

- Voil√†!

NOTES:

- If you want to use it with another save file, delete 'output.xlsx' and clear 'monstertxt.txt' before doing so.
